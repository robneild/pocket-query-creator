/**
 * <p>A collection of offline resources as defined in the
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080122/#appcache">HTML5 spec</a>.
 * Intended to support offline web applications.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> This class is essentially a skeleton implementation providing minimal
 * compatibility while we wait for the HTML5 dust to settle. The first real browser we should
 * worry about supporting with this implementation will probably be either Firefox 3.5
 * or Firefox 4.</p>
